This is a simple program that is intended to model the game of Mancala. Rules follow the "Oware" game rule set from: https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/mancala-rules.htm

Inspiration for this project primarily comes from playing this game a few times and wanting to find an "optimal" strategy and understand better some of the math in the game.
